# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
For this milestone, I replaced the motor that extends and retracts the arm with a stronger motor. Changing the motor stops the arm from stalling while fully extended. I’ve also decreased the movement speed of the motors so it’s easier to control the arm. The most enjoyable thing was designing the modified pieces to hold the larger motor using computer aided design through Onshape. Because the motor I was replacing was much smaller than its replacement, I had to redesign one of the sides of the arm to be able to install the big motor. I redesigned three pieces: the side, the motor retainer, and part of the arm itself. The hardest things were replacing the motors and properly powering the arm. After I accidentally fried my Arduino, I had to replace it as well as all my motors excluding the big one. It was hard because of how time consuming it was. After replacing all the motors and installing the bigger one, I couldn’t properly power my arm. The main cause of this problem was one of the replaced servos taking excessive power, leading to my arm not having sufficient power. After replacing the faulty motor, power was correctly distributed and my robotic arm worked as I wanted it to.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone which is completing the base project. I’ve completely assembled the arm as well as installed the code. The most enjoyable thing was assembling the arm itself. I like putting things together as well as following assembly instructions. I also enjoyed testing out the code. It was really nice watching the arm move around after assembling it. The hardest thing was compensating for missing parts. I was missing about five bolts of a specific length. I ended up using bolts from the extras bin.

# Starter Project
  
My starter project is the Useless Machine. When the switch is hit, a motor rotates an arm that comes out of the box to reset the switch. After the switch is reset, the motor reverses, bringing the arm back into the box until it hits a snap switch. Hitting the snap switch stops the motor. The most enjoyable part of building this was soldering. Out of all the skills required for assembling the Useless Machine, soldering was the newest skill I’ve learned. I really liked to practice soldering as well as using the solder pump and solder wick when those were needed. The hardest part was figuring out how to install the LED in a place where it wouldn’t interfere with the arm. The arm would hit the LED before the snap switch, which wasn’t supposed to happen. I solved this problem by moving the LED closer to the PCB. After moving the LED, the arm hits the snap switch before the LED. Another problem was the arm missing the switch. The arm would go to the side of the switch, jamming the machine. I fixed this by shifting the arm farther from the motor. If the arm was all the way on the motor shaft, it would miss the switch. However, if the arm was shifted off the shaft, it would hit the switch, allowing the machine to perform as intended.
