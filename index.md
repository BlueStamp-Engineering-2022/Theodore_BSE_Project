# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone which is completing the base project. I’ve completely assembled the arm as well as installed the code. The most enjoyable thing was assembling the arm itself. I like putting things together as well as following assembly instructions. I also enjoyed testing out the code. It was really nice watching the arm move around after assembling it. The hardest thing was compensating for missing parts. I was missing about five bolts of a specific length. I ended up using bolts from the extras bin.

# Starter Project
  
My starter project is the Useless Machine. When the switch is hit, a motor rotates an arm that comes out of the box to reset the switch. After the switch is reset, the motor reverses, bringing the arm back into the box until it hits a snap switch. Hitting the snap switch stops the motor. The most enjoyable part of building this was soldering. Out of all the skills required for assembling the Useless Machine, soldering was the newest skill I’ve learned. I really liked to practice soldering as well as using the solder pump and solder wick when those were needed. The hardest part was figuring out how to install the LED in a place where it wouldn’t interfere with the arm. The arm would hit the LED before the snap switch, which wasn’t supposed to happen. I solved this problem by moving the LED closer to the PCB. After moving the LED, the arm hits the snap switch before the LED. Another problem was the arm missing the switch. The arm would go to the side of the switch, jamming the machine. I fixed this by shifting the arm farther from the motor. If the arm was all the way on the motor shaft, it would miss the switch. However, if the arm was shifted off the shaft, it would hit the switch, allowing the machine to perform as intended.
